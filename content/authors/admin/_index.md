Hi, I'm Ran Li — a Research Scientist at a surgical robotics company, where I develop machine learning and medical imaging technologies to support more precise and efficient surgical procedures. I completed my PhD in Imaging Science at Washington University in St. Louis, specializing in MRI/PET analysis and deep learning for medical imaging. This blog is my space to share insights, document what I’m learning, and explore ideas at the intersection of AI and medical technology.
